/**
 * A class for tree normalization.  The default one does no normalization.
 * Other tree normalizers will change various node labels, or perhaps the
 * whole tree geometry (by doing such things as deleting functional tags or
 * empty elements).  Another operation that a {@code TreeNormalizer}
 * may wish to perform is interning the {@code String}s passed to
 * it.  Can be reused as a Singleton.  Designed to be extended.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * The {@code TreeNormalizer} methods are in two groups.
 * The contract for this class is that first normalizeTerminal or
 * normalizeNonterminal will be called on each {@code String} that will
 * be put into a {@code Tree}, when they are read from files or
 * otherwise created.  Then {@code normalizeWholeTree} will
 * be called on the {@code Tree}.  It normally walks the
 * {@code Tree} making whatever modifications it wishes to. A
 * {@code TreeNormalizer} need not make a deep copy of a
 * {@code Tree}.  It is assumed to be able to work destructively,
 * because afterwards we will only use the normalized {@code Tree}.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * &lt;i&gt;Implementation note:&lt;/i&gt; This is a very old legacy class used in conjunction
 * with PennTreeReader.  It seems now that it would be better to move the
 * String normalization into the tokenizer, and then we are just left with a
 * (possibly destructive) TreeTransformer.
